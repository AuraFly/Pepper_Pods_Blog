    "title": " Birdseye Charred Chive Dulse Hot Sauce | Marshall's Haute Sauce",
    "description": "One of my favorites",
    "content": "This special edition was made in collaboration with Sarah Marshall of Marshalls Haute Sauce to commemorate five years since the opening of our Brooklyn tasting room on April 20, 2015. This unique recipe was inspired by Southeast Asian flavors, with deep umami from white miso, dulse seaweed and roasted garlic. Sarah sources the briny dulse seaweed locally from the Oregon coast and it beautifully compliments everything from seafood to stir fry. When combined with sour vinegar and a hint of pineapple and ginger, you get a completely craveable sauce thats ready for dumplings, roasted brussel sprouts or as a marinade for fish and chicken.",
